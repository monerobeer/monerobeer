    <h1>Monero.Beer </h1>
    <p>Monero is a tool that enables you to privately receive value over the internet<p>
  </div>

  <div class="pad">
    <h2>Simple</h2>
    <p>Download a monero wallet (e.g. <a href="https://www.cakewallet.com/">iOS</a>, <a href="https://www.monerujo.com/">Android</a> & <a href="https://downloads.getmonero.org/gui/">Desktop</a>), label a sub-address and share it. No servers, no downtime.</p>
      
    <h2>Private receiving</h2>
    <p>Payments are made to <a href="https://web.getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/stealthaddress.html">Stealth Addresses</a>, your donation address never appears on chain so no-one can tell if you received any donations.</p>
      
    <h2>Private balance</h2>
    <p>Amounts are hidden on monero, so no-one knows how much you receive (only the sender!). There is no risk leaking your full balance amount when making a payment.</p>
      
    <h2>Private spending</h2>
    <p>Even the sender can't tell when you spend the monero they donate thanks to <a href="https://web.getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/ringsignatures.html">Ring Signatures</a>. This gives plausible deniability (you can claim you have spent when you haven't or claim you haven't spent when you have!)</p>
      
    <h2>What does a subaddress look like?</h2>
    <p>Sub-addresses start with an 8, for example:</p><code>83nNJxLgDZaL1L4sJSP6G2N3vYEyJ2RxFS5tMdWpsyvnKPraKLQJpgmjKeRcPYjJZ4F1kemTRXW7QQbYAaJAt1Nj6A4SmZR</code>
